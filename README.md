# TicTacToe

This is a simple tic tac toe game. I made this project a while ago out of boredom! :D

## Overview

This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, featuring an unbeatable AI opponent powered by the MiniMax algorithm. The game is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on modular and factory-based design principles. It provides an interactive interface for users to enjoy the game and test their skills against an intelligent AI.

## Features

- **Unbeatable AI:** The AI opponent uses the MiniMax algorithm to ensure it makes the best possible moves, making it a formidable opponent for players.

- **Player Sign Selection:** Players can choose their preferred sign (X or O), and the AI adapts accordingly.

- **AI Difficulty Levels:** Players can select from multiple AI difficulty levels, ranging from easy to unbeatable, adding flexibility to the gaming experience.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The game offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for players to enjoy the game.

- **Restart and Winner Recognition:** The project includes features for game restart and winner recognition. When the game ends, it displays a congratulatory message for the winner.

## Implementation Details

- **MiniMax Algorithm:** The unbeatable AI opponent is powered by the MiniMax algorithm, which explores all possible moves and predicts optimal moves for both the AI and the player.

- **Modular Design:** The code is organized using modular and factory-based design, minimizing global variables and promoting code maintainability.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to start playing.

## AI Difficulty Levels

- **Easy:** The AI makes random moves.

- **Medium:** The AI makes reasonably smart moves.

- **Hard:** The AI is a challenging opponent.

- **Unbeatable:** The AI uses the MiniMax algorithm and is practically unbeatable.
